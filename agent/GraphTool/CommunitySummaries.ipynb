Forms a 4-fold interpenetrated 3D network with sra topology. Hydration water present (6 H2O).

The synthesis details are not provided in the documents. This MOF exemplifies Zn2-based frameworks with BPPA and BDC ligands, where high interpenetration and sra nets yield dense packing and reduced porosity, a recurring theme in this community.

Structurally, it is triclinic with space group P1̅ and Z = 2, and features a seven-coordinate Cd(II) node in a distorted CdO5N2 pentagonal-bipyramidal geometry. The grouping emphasizes the robustness of the underlying topology under metal substitution (Zn to Cd) and the resulting shift in metal coordination environment while preserving the overall framework.

Synthesis is solvothermal: 4-aminobenzoic acid (0.5 mmol), MnCl2·4H2O, NaN3, ethanol/water, 393 K for 7 days, yielding brown needle crystals at 40%. Magnetic data show Mn2+ centers with χM = 3.6176 cm3 K mol−1 and a negative parameter (-84.07 K), suggesting weak antiferromagnetic interactions between Mn sites.

The framework exhibits ligand-centered luminescence with emission bands at 510, 604, and 626 nm, indicating multiple emissive ligand environments. Synthesis via solution growth from L and ZnCl2 in CH2Cl2 with a CH3CN/toluene/CH2Cl2 buffer yields yellow crystals after ~10 days.

The colorless crystal outcome hints at a ligand/cluster environment lacking strong visible chromophores, which can influence photophysical properties commonly explored in Ag-based MOFs but is not explicitly reported here.'}"
